# snippets
A common snippets used in BSource projects.

##  Javascript
### [Ext JS](https://github.com/BSourceSistemas/snippets/blob/main/javascript/ext.code-snippets)
This is a snippet that we use during our project developments with [Ext JS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/), there are several interesting routines that are used in our day like the snippet **dg**.

``` javascript
//<debug>
debugger;
//</debug>
```

Or Generating a new viewModel using snippet **newvm**.

``` javascript
Ext.define('BSource.view.products.ProductFeatureViewModel', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',
    alias: 'viewmodel.product-feature',
    data: {
        
    },
    stores: {

    },
    formulas: {

    }
});

```

We plan to bring other snippets that we use here for javascript and C#, so we ask you to give this page a star and follow our work.
